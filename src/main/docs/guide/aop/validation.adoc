Validation advice is one of the most common advice types you are likely to want to use in your application.

Validation advice is built on https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[Bean Validation JSR 380], a specification of the Java API for bean validation which ensures that the properties of a bean meet specific criteria, using `jakarta.validation` annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, and `@Max`.

link:{micronautvalidationdocs}/guide/[Micronaut Validation] provides native support for the `javax.validation` annotations.

NOTE: link:{micronautvalidationdocs}[Micronaut Validation] is not 100% compliant with https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[JSR 380]. If you need 100% compliance, try https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-hibernate-validator/snapshot/guide/[Micronaut Hibernate Validator].
